This Isotherm generator emulates the spreadsheet used by the USDA for isotherm generation.

This Isotherm generator has been verified over the last decade and has proven a useful tool.
This python performs a similar parameter fitting /optimization routine as the USDA spreadsheet but has several key benefits.
1) A GUI allows for ease of use.
2) Multiple isotherms for a single dataset can be produced all at once.
3) Output information on parameter fitting is compiled in an easy to read .csv
4) The .exe compiled file allows the user to run the program on any computer without an programming knowledge
5) The open sourced python code allows advanced users to modify and add functionality to code.
6) Plots with approximate 95% confidence intervals are produced for isotherms
7) Parameter optimization of the python solver is not highly dependent on the initial guess of the user.
8) Datasets can be quickly/easily uploaded into the program.
